This is a test repository to experiment with GitHub's "privately reporting a
security vulnerability" workflow, see
<https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability>

If or when security vulnerabilities or advisories appear against this specific
repository, they are expected to be as a result of experimenting with this
workflow and not be actual vulnerabilities.
